I was not able to get reliable data out of this unit.
Simply reading with the analog pins gives contant numbers whether using 1 or 2 out pins.
There were some changes in the values when I used a compressed air can to blow on the unit.
Probably the my calculation was bad, so yeah, try again some later time.

TODO read with digital pins
Also, it might matter what voltage you input, it will adjust the output voltage as well. Make sure logic levels match.
Also, power it from a clean power source, to avoid any noise to alter our results.

Figure out test cases, like frying oil should put particles in air :D
