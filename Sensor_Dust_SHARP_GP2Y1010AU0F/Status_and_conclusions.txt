Using the code in the working folder 1, I was able to get coherent results out of the unit.
Blowing ecigarette smoke on the unit raised the values output by the program.
However, otherwise the values went back to 0. Thus it is probably not really sensitive.

I would imagine that a fan is required to circulate air to and from the unit.
